WriTex

Students and professionals in the sciences often use LaTex to formally and cleanly display their work and ideas. However, LaTex contains a slight learning curve; WriTex attempts to alleviate any sort of learning curve by being fully accessible to anyone, even those with no experience with LaTex. 

WriTex takes in an image or real-time handwriting of text and symbols and converts it into LaTex code that can be later used to generate a PDF file.
