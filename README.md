WriTeX

Students and professionals often use LaTeX to formally and cleanly display their work and ideas in a standardized format. However, LaTeX often contains a learning curve on the order of magnitude of several tens of hours; WriTeX alleviates this learning curve by being fully accessible to anyone interested in converting their written work directly into a LaTeX file.

WriTeX takes in an image of handwritten text and symbols and converts it into LaTeX code that can be utilized in a more universal fashion.
