WriTex

Students and professionals in the sciences often use LaTeX to formally and cleanly display their work and ideas. However, LaTeX contains a learning curve on the order of magnitude of several tens of hours; WriTeX attempts to alleviate this learning curve by being fully accessible to anyone, even those with no experience with LaTeX. 

WriTeX takes in an image of handwritten text and symbols and converts it into LaTeX code that can be utilized in a more universal fashion.
