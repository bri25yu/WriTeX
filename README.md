WriTeX

Students and professionals often use LaTeX to formally and cleanly display their work and ideas in a standardized format. However, LaTeX contains a substantial learning curve; WriTeX alleviates this learning curve by being fully accessible to anyone interested in converting their written work directly into a LaTeX file. 

WriTeX takes in an image of handwritten text and symbols and converts it into LaTeX code that can be utilized in a more universal fashion.
